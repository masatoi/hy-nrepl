# hy-nrepl
[![hy-nrepl unit test](https://github.com/masatoi/hy-nrepl/actions/workflows/hyrepl_test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/masatoi/hy-nrepl/actions/workflows/hyrepl_test.yaml)

hy-nrepl is an implementation of the [nREPL](https://nrepl.org) protocol for [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy).

## Implemented Operations

from [nREPL Built-in Ops](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/1.3/ops.html)

- [ ] add-middleware
- [x] clone
- [x] close
- [x] completions
- [x] describe
- [x] eval
- [x] interrupt
- [x] load-file
- [x] lookup
- [ ] ls-middleware
- [x] ls-sessions
- [x] stdin
- [ ] swap-middleware

## Usage
hy-nrepl requires Python 3.11 and Hy over 0.2.9.

To install

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/masatoi/hy-nrepl.git
```

To run server, (default port is 7888)
```sh
hyrepl

# Output debug log and specify port
hyrepl --debug 7888
```

To run the tests, simply execute `pytest tests` in project root directory.

## Confirmed working nREPL clients

### Emacs
The following combinations are currently confirmed to work stably.

- [hy-mode](https://github.com/hylang/hy-mode) + [Rail](https://github.com/masatoi/Rail)
  - REPL (Eval and Interruption)
  - Symbol completion
  - Eldoc (Function arg documentations)
  - Jump to source

This list is not exhaustive, and hy-nrepl does not support all features offered by these clients, such as advanced debugger integration, profiling or tracing. Jump to source is also not supported.

### Lighttable
* Support live eval by connecting with `Clojure nrepl`. Still basic and buggy 

### Vim
* `fireplace` with [vim-hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy) to provide the
  necessary glue

### Emacs
* `cider`
* `monroe`

### Console
* `python-nrepl-client`

Using hy-nrepl with fireplace
===========================

For the best integration, install [vim-hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy). It
offers syntax highlighting and indentation support as well as wrappers around
fireplace to make it more Hy-friendly.

Run `hy -m hy-nrepl.server` in your target directory and open a Hy file in vim.
You can also use `:setf hy` to set the file type explicitly.  Connect vim to the
REPL with `:Connect`.  Use `nrepl` as the protocol, `localhost` as the host and
the port number hy-nrepl printed on start.

Without `vim-hy`
----------------
Open a Hy file and set the file type to `clojure`: `set filetype=clojure`. This
will suck because it doesn't support `:Doc`. Other things might be broken as
well.

Missing features
----------------
* `:Require[!]` does not yet work. Use `:%Eval` to evaluate complete files.
* fireplace uses a lot of clojure-specific pieces of code. Most of these could
  be transformed with workarounds.

Using hy-nrepl inside your own programs
=====================================
You can use hy-nrepl to add a remote control to your own programs. The following
steps are a small example:

    (import time
      [hy-nrepl.server :as repl]
      [hy-nrepl.middleware.eval :as repl-mw])
    (setv (. repl-mw eval-module) (globals))
    (defmain [&rest args]
      (let [[s (repl.start-server)]]
        (print (.format "Listening on {}" (. (second s) server-address)))
        (while True
          (time.sleep 1))))
